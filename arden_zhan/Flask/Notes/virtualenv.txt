virtualenv

In order to use Flask (or any pip module) we'll need to use a virtualenv.

What is a python virtual environment?
    Tool used for creating unique sandboxes to control project dependencies. Each virtual environment can contain different versions of Python, Flask, or any combination of packages

    virtualenv helps to stay organized, flexible when working on multiple projects that may have different dependencies. Allow using different software versions than system-wide installation of Python and pip installed packages.

How does virtualenv help?
    A good use case for using the virtualenv Python module is a scenario where we're working on multiple project each with varying dependencies
    Project 0 - Python 2.7, Flask 0.10
    Project 1 - Python 2.7, Flask 0.12, etc.

Virtual environments are not single use. If start with another that has same dependencies as Project 0, then can use virtual environment that we already have.
