Basic Form Validation

Validation is more of a logical challenge than new code to learn

logic: what data do we want to validate?
checking if data is present
making sure data is in correct format
sending user to correct destination whether their data is valid or not
alerting the user of their errors (if they exist)

1. How to check if input field is empty and how to display the errors if it is
- centers around using if, else statements that return TRUE or FALSE depending on if data is valid

pseudo:
IF the name in field in POST data is empty:
    display validation errors
ELSE:
    display success message


To check if name field is empty, can use python built in function len()

len() returns length of string
- if len(request.form['name']) < 1: basically same as session.get() == None



Flash Messages on Server
- flash messages are strings that exist for one redirect cycle. 
- similar to session, can access flash messages through embedded python tags {{ }} & {% %} on views and display to user
- Flash messages last for one redirect, session stays until it is manually popped

Flash messages are good for validations where we only need to display the error or message temporarily
- flash("string")


Flash Messages on the Client
Flask has function on client side that allows us to get all flash messages as list
get_flashed_messages()

with messages = get_flashed_messages()
    - the with messages here declares variable in template that we can use within specific scope
