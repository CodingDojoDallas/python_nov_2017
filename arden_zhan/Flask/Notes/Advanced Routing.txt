Advanced Routing
One to pass data from client to server is via forms. Other ways:


Passing data from the client to the server through the URL
- we can already define basic route handlers that take care of static routes
- we want to have route '/users/___' where anything that comes after '/users/' is passed as variable to route handlers
    - '/users/jay' displays page that says Hello Jay 
    - '/users/anna' displays page that says Hello Anna 
    - both without having to write 2 different route handlers


Route just needs to have placeholder after the '/users/'
- placeholder designated in <> tags
- name inside tags should match parameter name passed to the route handler function

@app.route('/route/with/<vararg>')
def handler_function(vararg):
  # here you can use the variable "vararg"
  # if you want to see what our argument looks like
  print vararg
  # we could do other things with this information from this point on such as:
  # use it to retrieve some records from the database
  # render a particular template
