Flask is able to send HTML files to the client in response to a request. 

Templates, also known as views

Templates are HTML files that are interpreted by Flask and then served to the client. 
    - rendering Templates
    - every web development framework provides a way to render templates
    - can pass data to template and display it dynamically

All templates placed in folder called templates

In HTML file:
    - within p tags can have text with {{variable}}
    - return render_template("index.html", variable="Jay")

    {{variable}} in the HTML file will be replaced by what was passed in render_template function


Flask uses templating engine called Jinja2 to parse through files looking for {{}}
    - replaces variables with real values,
    - and sends a complete HTML file back to the client

Can also insert Python-like code into template
