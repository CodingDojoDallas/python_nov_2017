Basic Routes

Routes are essentials for any web application. Route is like a variable name we assign to a request.
    - job is to communicate to server what kind of info the client needs
    - route name is attached to route on server that points to specific set of instructions
    - instructions contain info about:
        - how to interpret data being sent
        - operations that need to be completed
        - response that should be sent back
    - these instructions are the code we'll be creating

Every route has two parts
    1. HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
    2. URL

GET
We are handling the root route, '/', route with hello_world() that renders index.html
The HTTP verb is GET

ALL ROUTES DEFAULT TO GET!
If no route explicitly mentioned, it's a GET route. 
GET routes mostly used for serving pages or rendering templates.



Route Structure
Generic Route:
@app.route('/some_route')
def some_function_name():
    //code

above route would be triggered when user requests
localhost:5000/some_route

Our route rules are used to define what comes after the initial forward-slash.
When request matching our routing rules is received by server, function that immediately follows the @app.route('/some_route/) is invoked
