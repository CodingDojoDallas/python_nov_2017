Hidden Inputs

hidden input fields are form fields that are hidden from user. used to transfer info between different pages
- just an ordinary input element with type="hidden", so no visual representation in rendered HTML, but form element is usable by method where form is sent

Multiple purposes, but going to focus on how to use field to navigate submitted forms to appropriate function / process
