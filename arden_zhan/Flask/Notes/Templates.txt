Flask Templates

2 special inputs that we can use to insert Python-like code into Flask Templates
- code is limited
- cannot use full range of python functionality in template (html file)
- some of python's advanced functionality is missing

{{some variable}}
{{% some expression %}}

return render_template("index.html", phrase="hello", times=5)
{% for x in range(0, times): %}
    {{phrase}}
{% endfor %}


- can technically do a lot of logic in templates, but should try to limit as much as possible
- better to do logic in python code
- if too much logic in template, can slow down server response times


Flask uses Jinja2
    - Jinja2 has a lot of built-in features that allow placing dynamic info on HTML pages
    - should check Jinja2 documentation for templates
