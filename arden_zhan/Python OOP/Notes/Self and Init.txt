Self and __init__()

Class: instructions for how to build many objects that share characteristics
Object: data type built according to specifications provided by class definition
Attribute: value. kind of like a variable that is stored within an objects
Method: set of instructions. functions associated with an object

Self
The first parameter in our methods will be self. Do not need to pass arguments, self has implicit passage.
We can change state of single object by making modifications to self.
Self parameter includes all the info about the individual object that has called the method.
Without self, every time we changed a object's attributes, we'd be changing the attribute for all the items of that type. 
Self is for specific object

__init__()
__init__() is a magic method. Magic method are automatically created and sometimes invoked when new instances of a class are created. __init__ is one we'll be working with in most classes

    - useful because it allows us to set some attributes when new instance is created. ran immediately, so we can pass params through it upon object creation
