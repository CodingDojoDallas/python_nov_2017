Want to pass in variable number of args, or capture multiple args into single parameter?

Placing asterisk before name of parameter after the "normal" parameters does just that

splat operator

def varargs(arg1, *args):
  print "Got " + arg1 + " and " + ", ".join(args)
varargs("one") # output: "Got one and "
varargs("one", "two") # output: "Got one and two"
varargs("one", "two", "three") # output: "Got one and two, three"

splat operator bundles remaining arguments into a new TUPLE, then assigned to parameter

type(args) from above would give <type 'tuple'>
