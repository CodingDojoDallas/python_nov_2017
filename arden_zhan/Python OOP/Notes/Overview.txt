OOP (Object Oriented Programming)
    - saves time
    - avoids repeating code
    - easier maintenance
    - more organized and modular

OOP and the Web
OOP allows us to create a blueprint for reproducing objects. 

User class
The blueprint for each user just tells what attributes we need to track for each user. Every user doesn't have to be the same.

Class Structure
class User(object):
    pass

object parameter means that the class inherits from the object class
pass means do nothing

def __init__(self):
#__init__ method is called every time a new object created
new object creation includes passing parameters. everything we pass is passed into the init method

After creating the user class blueprint, we create instances of the class

Classes include 2 things
    - attributes: characteristics shared by all instances of class
    - methods: actions that the object can perform
storage of info, and ability to execute some logic
