Can do multiple method calls by attaching to end of previous one
user1.login().show().logout()
instead of 
user1.login()
user1.show()
user1.logout()

jQuery also lets us chain. 
since user1.login() returns user1 instance, then you can do (user1.login()).show(), which chains

Self refers to individual instance of the object
class User(object):
    def login(self):
        //code
        return self

return self
- returns its own instance which allows chaining methods after calling that method

OOP returning its own instance is common and can be done in other languages too.
some languages return this, instead of python's return self
