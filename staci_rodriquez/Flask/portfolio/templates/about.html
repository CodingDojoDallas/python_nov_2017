	<p>I am new to computer coding and programming! I did really well in Web Fund, but i have been struggling with Python. I failed my belt tests and had to retake the course. No worries though because i will relearn everything and have a better understanding of the things i missed and should be able to pass the first time when i retake my belt:)</p>
